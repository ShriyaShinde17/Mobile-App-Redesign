# Mobile-App-Redesign

Original Swiggy UI (Common Pain Points)
1. Cluttered Home Screen
Too many items on the screen at once — categories, ads, recommendations — making it feel overwhelming.

2. Overloaded Restaurant Cards
Restaurant cards contain:
Big images
Ratings
Delivery time
Offers
Tags
This makes the UI look busy.

3. Mixed Colors & Visual Noise
Orange, green, blue, ads, badges — too many elements compete for attention.

4. Order Tracking Is Crowded
Multiple icons, animations, and notifications make the tracking screen feel heavy.

5. Navigation feels slightly heavy
Many tabs, banners, deal pop-ups, and menus add to cognitive load for users.


Improvements Made in the Redesigned Prototype

1. Simplified Home Layout
Removed unnecessary elements and kept:
Title
Search bar
Categories
Popular restaurants
This creates a calm and clear first impression.

2. Clean Restaurant Cards
Cards now show only:
Name
Rating
Cuisine
This reduces distraction and improves readability.

3. Minimal Light Mode Theme
White background + soft grey cards → cleaner and less noisy UI.

4. Better Visual Hierarchy
Spacing, alignment, and consistent card design help users understand information quickly.

5. Straightforward Navigation Flow
Home → Restaurants List → Order Tracking
This makes the interaction simple and intuitive.

6. Simple Order Tracking Screen
Only four clear stages with colored indicators:
Order Confirmed
Preparing
Out for Delivery
Delivered
No clutter, no ads, no extra icons.

7. Reduced Cognitive Load
Fewer colors, fewer elements, and a cleaner layout make the experience easier for users.
